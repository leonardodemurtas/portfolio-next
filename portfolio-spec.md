  Focus on AI design systems and decision tools for enterprise risk and credit (e.g. risk analysts, credit managers, portfolio owners).

**Primary content**

* Three tiles linking to hero case studies:

  1. Design System for Enterprise Risk
  2. Credit Portfolio Monitoring / Distressed Positions
  3. AI Pattern Case (contextual AI patterns)
* Quick stats strip:

  * Years of experience
  * Products shipped
  * Domain focus (risk, credit, B2B SaaS)
  * Location / remote preference (optional)

**Secondary content**

* One short paragraph about how I work (systems, patterns, AI).

## 4. Hero Case Studies (3 pages)

### 4.1 Shared template

Use the same structure for all three:

1. **Snapshot (top)**

   * 2–3 line summary: product, audience, my role, key outcome.
   * Quick metadata: company, timeframe, role, team.

2. **Problem & Context**

   * The business problem.
   * The user problem.
   * Constraints (time, legacy systems, data, stakeholders).

3. **System / Solution**

   * System view: tokens, components, templates, flows.
   * Key decisions and trade-offs.
   * How the system supports multiple products or teams.

4. **AI Angle**

   * Where AI appears in the experience (patterns, assistants, automation).
   * How AI changed workflows, not just UI.

5. **Key Flows & Screens**

   * 3–6 core flows or screens.
   * For each: goal → before/after (if relevant) → outcome.

6. **Impact**

   * Concrete impact (qualitative + directional metrics if available).
   * Stakeholder feedback.

7. **What I’d Improve Next**

   * 3 bullet points about what you’d change with more time.

8. **Assets**

   * Embed or link to:

     * Loom walkthrough.
     * Figma or prototype links (where possible).

### 4.2 Case 1 – Design System for Enterprise Risk

* Emphasis:

  * Multi-product design system.
  * Tokens, components, templates.
  * Adoption across tools and teams.
  * How AI-ready patterns were baked into the system.

### 4.3 Case 2 – Credit Portfolio Monitoring / Distressed Positions

* Emphasis:

  * Helping analysts monitor distressed positions.
  * Surfacing negative events, risk signals, and timelines.
  * AI contribution (prioritisation, summaries, suggestions).

### 4.4 Case 3 – AI Pattern Case

* Emphasis:

  * Contextual integration of AI into existing workflows.
  * Before/after of the workflow.
  * Reusable AI patterns (overlays, explainers, assistants).

## 5. AI Patterns & Writing

**Intro**

* Short paragraph explaining that I document AI UX patterns and write about:

  * Contextual integration.
  * Decision support tools.
  * AI-assisted workflows for experts.

**Content list**

* 3–5 featured items:

  * Title
  * 1–2 line description (what it’s about, who it helps)
  * Link (Medium, Substack, etc.)

Optionally group by theme (e.g. “Contextual patterns”, “Voice & agents”).

---

## 6. Mentoring & Training

**Intro**

* One short paragraph about mentoring and training:

  * Topics (design systems, AI patterns, workflow design).
  * Typical audience (junior designers, product teams).

**Content**

* 2–4 “training pills”:

  * Title
  * 1–2 lines on what the session covers.
  * Format (talk, workshop, 1:1).

* Optional:

  * Testimonials or short quotes if you have them.

---

## 7. Archive

**Purpose**

* “Selected earlier work and experiments.”

**Layout**

* Simple responsive grid of cards:

  * Thumbnail
  * Project title
  * One-line description
  * Tag(s) such as “legacy”, “experiment”, “concept”.

Older projects get less detail to keep focus on the hero cases.
